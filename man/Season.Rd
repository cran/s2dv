\title{Compute seasonal mean or other calculations}
\usage{
Season(
  data,
  time_dim = "ftime",
  monini,
  moninf,
  monsup,
  method = mean,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  ncores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A named numeric array with at least one dimension 'time_dim'.}

\item{time_dim}{A character string indicating the name of dimension along
which the seasonal mean or other calculations are computed. The default
value is 'ftime'.}

\item{monini}{An integer indicating what the first month of the time series is. 
It can be from 1 to 12.}

\item{moninf}{An integer indicating the starting month of the seasonal
calculation. It can be from 1 to 12.}

\item{monsup}{An integer indicating the end month of the seasonal calculation. 
It can be from 1 to 12.}

\item{method}{An R function to be applied for seasonal calculation. For
example, 'sum' can be used for total precipitation. The default value is mean.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether to remove NA values along 
'time_dim' when calculating climatology (TRUE) or return NA if there is NA 
along 'time_dim' (FALSE). The default value is TRUE.}

\item{ncores}{An integer indicating the number of cores to use for parallel 
computation. The default value is NULL.}
}
\value{
An array with the same dimensions as data except along the 'time_dim' 
 dimension, of which the length changes to the number of seasons.
}
\description{
Compute the seasonal mean (or other methods) on monthly time series along
one dimension of a named multi-dimensional arrays. Partial season is not 
accounted.
